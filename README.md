# Hotelify
HackOWASP

This project, built during a hackathon, provides a user-friendly web application for hotel guests, allowing them to conveniently:

Order food directly: Eliminate the need for phone calls with a streamlined interface for placing food orders.
Access room service: Enjoy the comfort of room service through a few simple clicks within the app.
Manage bookings: (Optional: If your app includes booking functionality) Simplify the check-in process or manage existing reservations.
Utilize NFC for keyless entry: (Optional: If your app integrates with NFC) Offer a convenient alternative for accessing rooms if a physical key is lost (requires compatible hardware).

This project was developed within the constraints of a hackathon, focusing on rapid prototyping and demonstrating core functionalities. While the project is functional, it may require further development for production use, such as:

Enhanced security measures
Extensive testing and bug fixing
Integration with backend services (if applicable) for order management and room service requests
Scalability considerations for handling a larger user base
